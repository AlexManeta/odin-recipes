    <h3>Ingredients and Recommended Substitutes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All purpose Flour - 45g
            <ul>
                <p><li>Wheat Flour</li>
                <li>Gluten-Free: Oat Flour</li>
                <li>Low Carb: Almond Flour - 42g</li></p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Chocolate Whey Protein Powder - 36g
            <ul>

            <p><li>Whey/Casein blend</li>
            <li>Vegan: Soy Protein, Pea Protrein</li></p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Erythritol (135g) – provides volume and yields a shiny crust!
            <ul>
                <p><li>Regular Sugar, Monkfruit sweetener, Xylitol in equal amounts</li>
                <li>Swerve, but Boo says to use less</li>
                <li>Boo’s original Ridiculous Brownies recipe calls for 135g of erythritol, which I reduced to 100g. If you don’t have much of a sweet tooth or use a very sweet protein powder, feel free to reduce this by a further 20-30g!</li></p>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Cocoa Powder (63g)</li>
        <li>Baking Powder (1/2 tsp or 3g)</li>
        <li>Salt (just a pinch!)</li>
        <li>Diet Coke (300 – 360g)
            <ul>
                <p><li>Any other carbonated drink will work fine (Cream Soda, Pepsi, Ginger Ale, Sparkling Water…)</li>
                <li>Milk/ Coffee / Water with extra baking powder has been said to work if you can’t access carbonated beverages</li></p>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (375°F)</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients (cocoa, protein powder, oat flour, erythritol, baking powder and salt.. everything but your carbonated liquid) until evenly distributed. My cocoa powder was clumpy, so I used a sieve to break up all the lumps!</li>
        <li>Into the dry mixture, lightly stir in your carbonated beverage until no lumps remain. The batter should be very liquid and begin spewing bubbles! Immediately pour into your greased/lined 8”x8” pan and bake for 25 - 35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted. </li>
        <li>Let cool in the pan for 5 more minutes after baking, then an additional 30 minutes out of the pan before slicing and storing. As Boo notes, the brownies continue to cook in the pan after leaving the oven, and may not have set completely. </li>
        <li>"Bonus tip: I wrapped mine individually in aluminium foil (because portion control lol) and reheated them in the microwave with a dollop of peanut butter… SO FUDGY!"</li>
    </ol>
